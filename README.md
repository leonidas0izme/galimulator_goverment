goverment.json Files so you have have more variety to what type of goverment your nation will be!
PLEASE BACKUP YOUR ORIGINAL goverment.json FILES BEFORE REPLACING!
How to backup:
Go to local files via steam
go to data
copy your goverment.json folder
make a new folder named "backup" or whatever will signify you that its a backup
ONLY IF MULTIPLE JSON: Make a new seperate folder inside the backup folder so it dosen't get replaced on accident
paste your file into the main folder (or into a subfolder if you have multiple)
now you can replace the goverment.json file in the galimulator game files.
